# SLM-confocal
Overview:
This project achieves confocal imaging by inserting an inexpensive spatial light modulator into a standard widefield microscope. Further details and testing available at Y. L. Wang, et al. Confocal imaging capacity on a widefield microscope using a spatial light modulator. PLOS ONE 16, e0244034 (2021). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0244034.
The project is written in Matlab 2020a.
The project is used for control a Nikon Ti2 microscope, a homemade Spatial Light Modulator extracted from an Epson 1810P projector, a Nikon/Lumencor Sola light engine, and an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera.
In order to run those codes, you need to have Nikon Ti2 SDK and Andor SDK for Matlab installed in your computer. Those SDK are provided by Nikon and Andor, please reach them for more information.
